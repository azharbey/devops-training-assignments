What are the three stages of GIT?
Git has three main states that your files can reside in: modified, staged, and committed.
Difference between GIT & GITHUB?
Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
Define CI & CD?
Continuous Delivery is the automation of steps to safely get changes into production. Where Continuous Deployment focuses on the actual deployment, Continuous Delivery focuses on the release and release strategy. An elusive goal would be a “push of a button” to get changes into production.
