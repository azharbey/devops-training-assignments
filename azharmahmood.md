What is difference between VM's and Container?
Container shares the host OS kernel, Every VM has its own OS and resources like Ram, Hard Disk. VMs are of few GBs and Containers are lightweight (KBs/MBs).  Ready-made VMs are difficult to find while Pre-built docker containers are easily available. VMs can move to new host easily while Containers are destroyed and re-created rather than moving. Creating VM takes a relatively longer time while Containers can be created in seconds.
